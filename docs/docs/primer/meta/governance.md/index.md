# Primer Governance

This rule governs the creation, modification, and use of primers within the XPlain-R framework.

## Governing Principle
Primers exist to guide interpretation, not to prescribe outcomes.

They must operate within the constraints of the Meta-Primer and the Framework at all times.

## Meta-Primer Authority
The Meta-Primer is authoritative.

- It defines the rules of interpretation.
- It may not be overridden by any Topical Primer.
- Changes to the Meta-Primer are rare, deliberate, and explicitly documented.

## Topical Primer Governance
Topical Primers may be created or updated where:
- a clear professional domain is defined
- boundaries and exclusions are explicitly stated
- alignment with the Meta-Primer is demonstrated

Topical Primers must not:
- introduce new interpretive rules
- redefine framework principles
- embed scoring logic or execution steps

## Change Control
All primer changes must:
- state the reason for change
- identify affected domains or methods
- preserve traceability to prior versions

## Review and Assurance
Primers are subject to periodic review to ensure:
- continued relevance
- internal consistency
- alignment with observed practice

Where conflict arises, the Meta-Primer prevails.
