# Work Instructions

Work Instructions describe how the XPlain-R framework and its methods are applied in practice.

They translate analytical intent into executable steps, ensuring that use of the framework is
consistent, repeatable, and auditable across users and contexts.

## Purpose
Work Instructions exist to:
- guide practical execution of methods
- reduce variation in application
- support training, assurance, and review

## Scope
Work Instructions address:
- required inputs and preconditions
- ordered execution steps
- expected outputs and checks

They do not explain analytical rationale or scoring logic in depth.

## Relationship to Other Components
- **Framework** defines what XPlain-R is and how it is structured
- **Method Statements** explain how evaluation is designed
- **Primers** guide interpretation and signal recognition

Work Instructions focus on *doing*, not *deciding*.

They may be adapted to local operational contexts, provided alignment with the framework
and methods is maintained.
