# History

The History section documents the development of the XPlain-R framework over time.

It explains why the framework exists, the problems it was designed to address, and how its
structure and emphasis have evolved in response to practical experience.

## Purpose
The History:
- provides context for current design choices
- records key moments of change or refinement
- supports transparency without prescribing future direction

## Scope
This section covers:
- the original motivations and use cases
- significant stages in the framework’s evolution
- major inflection points that influenced structure or scope

It is not a changelog and does not enumerate minor revisions or implementation details.

## Relationship to Other Components
- **Foundations** explain what the framework is built on
- **Principles** explain how it is intended to function
- **Methods and Work Instructions** describe how it is applied

The History exists to inform understanding, not to constrain interpretation or future development.
