# Method Statements

Method Statements describe how evaluation and analysis are performed within the XPlain-R
framework.

They explain the logic, structure, and sequencing of analytical activity in a way that is
transparent, defensible, and suitable for professional scrutiny.

## Purpose
Method Statements exist to:
- explain how conclusions are reached
- support repeatability and consistency
- allow methods to be reviewed, challenged, and improved

## Scope
Method Statements address:
- analytical models and reasoning approaches
- scoring and weighting logic
- validation and sense-checking mechanisms

They do not provide step-by-step operational guidance.

## Relationship to Other Components
- **Framework** defines the structural and conceptual boundaries
- **Meta-Primer** governs how interpretation is performed
- **Topical Primers** inform domain-specific interpretation
- **Work Instructions** describe how methods are executed in practice

Method Statements sit between conceptual intent and operational execution.

They are expected to evolve as evidence accumulates, while remaining traceable and
internally consistent.
