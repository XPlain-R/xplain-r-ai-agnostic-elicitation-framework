# Framework

The XPlain-R framework defines the overall structure, intent, and boundaries of the system.

It establishes what XPlain-R is, what it is designed to do, and how its constituent parts fit
together. The framework provides coherence across primers, methods, and work instructions
without prescribing their detailed content.

## Purpose
The framework exists to:
- provide a clear structural model for the system
- establish shared understanding across users and domains
- separate foundational intent from operational execution

## Scope
The framework addresses:
- the conceptual structure of XPlain-R
- the principles that guide its design and use
- the boundaries within which methods and primers operate

It does not define scoring models, execution steps, or domain-specific interpretation.

## Components
The framework is organised into the following elements:

- **Overview**  
  A high-level description of the framework’s structure and intent.

- **Foundations**  
  The first principles, assumptions, and constraints that underpin the framework.

- **History**  
  The origins and evolution of the framework, providing context for current design choices.

- **Principles**  
  The guiding rules that shape how the framework is intended to function.

- **Governance**  
  How the framework is maintained, updated, and applied responsibly.

Together, these components provide a stable reference point against which all other
materials can be interpreted.

The framework is designed to be durable, with change occurring deliberately rather than
incrementally.
