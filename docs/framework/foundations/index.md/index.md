# Foundations

The Foundations section sets out the underlying basis on which the XPlain-R framework is built.

It makes explicit the assumptions, constraints, and first principles that shape the framework’s
design and behaviour. This material exists to support clarity, scrutiny, and informed use.

## Purpose
The Foundations:
- articulate the rationale behind the framework
- expose key assumptions that influence interpretation
- define constraints that limit scope and prevent misuse

## Scope
This section addresses:
- first principles that guide the framework’s construction
- interpretive assumptions made explicit rather than implicit
- structural and design constraints adopted deliberately

It does not describe operational methods, scoring, or execution steps.

## Relationship to Other Components
- **Framework Principles** describe how the framework is intended to operate
- **Meta-Primer** governs how interpretation is performed
- **Methods** describe how evaluation is carried out in practice

The Foundations provide the grounding against which these components can be understood
and assessed.

Changes to the Foundations are rare and intentional, reflecting shifts in understanding rather
than incremental refinement.
