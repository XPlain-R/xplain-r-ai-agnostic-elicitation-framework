# Meta-Primer

The Meta-Primer defines how interpretation occurs within the XPlain-R framework.

It does not provide domain advice, evaluation criteria, or conclusions.  
Instead, it governs the *rules, constraints, and behaviours* by which an AI system
derives meaning from structured and unstructured inputs.

The Meta-Primer ensures that interpretation is:
- consistent across contexts
- explainable to human reviewers
- resistant to drift, overfitting, or goal substitution

## What the Meta-Primer Is
- A constitutional layer for interpretation
- A set of governing principles and constraints
- A mechanism for maintaining coherence across analyses

## What the Meta-Primer Is Not
- A checklist
- A scoring model
- A domain-specific guide
- A substitute for professional judgement

## Relationship to Other Components
- **Topical Primers** apply these rules to specific domains
- **Methods** define how evaluation and scoring are performed
- **Work Instructions** describe how the framework is executed in practice

The Meta-Primer remains stable by design.  
Changes are intentional, rare, and traceable.
