# Topical Primers

Topical Primers apply the Meta-Primer to a specific professional domain.

They define:
- what constitutes meaningful signal in a given context
- common patterns, structures, and artefacts
- typical failure modes and blind spots

Topical Primers do **not** override the Meta-Primer.  
They operate within its constraints.

## Purpose
Topical Primers exist to:
- reduce ambiguity in domain interpretation
- improve consistency across similar analyses
- make expert expectations explicit

## Characteristics
Topical Primers are:
- bounded in scope
- domain-specific
- allowed to evolve as practice matures

Each Topical Primer follows a standard structure to ensure comparability
and auditability across domains.

## Typical Structure
- Domain context and boundaries
- Expected artefacts and signals
- Interpretation cues and weighting
- Known distortions or risks
- Relationship to methods and scoring

New Topical Primers may be added without modifying the Meta-Primer.
